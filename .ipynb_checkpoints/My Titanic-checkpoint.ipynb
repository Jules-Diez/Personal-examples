    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships."

For example, a lot of classifiers calculate the distance between two points by the Euclidean distance. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.\n",

    " \n",
    "    The result of standardization is that the features will be rescaled so that they'll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = 1$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Compute as follow :\n",
