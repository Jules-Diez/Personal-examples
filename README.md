# Personal-examples
My personal examples concerning some projects that I want to share with anyone interested.

Feel free to use it in any way you want.


### TITANIC with Scikit-Learn
- [Titanic: Complete Journey Through A First Attempt To Submit](https://github.com/Jules-Diez/Personal-examples/blob/master/Titanic%20Complete%20Journey%20Through%20A%20First%20Attempt%20To%20Submit.ipynb)

Personal project to improve my skills in Python, using mostly matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas and scikit-learn.
I decided to share it on Kaggle to help fellow Kagglers that are starting with machine learning and statistic, so I tried to add some comments about what I'm doing and some notes about useful subjects. Thus, I chose to share a version where feature selection and model tuning are on their first attempts but analyzes and tools are already implemented and ready to use. 

### Not_MNIST with Tensorflow
